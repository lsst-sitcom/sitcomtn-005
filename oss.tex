\section{Observatory System Specifications (LSE-30) Verifcation}  \label{sec:oss}

\subsection{Operations Readiness Requirement}
The project team shall demonstrate that the integrated LSST systems (Camera, Telescope \& Site and Data Management subsystems) as well as the Education and Public Outreach (EPO) system have met the technical specifications enumerated in the LSST Observatory System Specifications (\citeds{LSE-30}).

%new_hd
The requirements in \citeds{LSE-30} have been marked according to the CCR where they can be earliest verified. 
The distribution between the CCRs is shown in Figure~\ref{CCRs_overview}.

\subsection{Objectives}
The main objective of this Operations Readiness Requirement is to verify the system specifications in the OSS (\citeds{LSE-30}) are proven and well documented. The OSS is essentially the highest-level document describing the basic LSST system technical architecture. It contains sections derived from the LSR on the following broad topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item System Composition and Constraints

\item Common System Functions and Performance, including:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item System Control
		%new_hd
		The System Control is implemented by combining a Service Abstraction Layer (SAL) and a number of Commandable SAL Components (CSC).
		A CSC represents each System and Subsystem in the observatory.
		Each CSC has a well-defined interface with the SAL. All other CSCs are required to comply with the definition of the interface.
		Therefore, the interface definitions are handled as requirements and verified as such. 
		Each interface requirement is verified through unit testing on the teststands at each new release and with the hardware during system usage.  
		Artifact?
		
		\item System Monitoring and Diagnostics
		%new_hd
		As part of the communication between the CSCs, messages with Commands, Events, and Telemetry are exchanged. 
		These are stored in real-time in the Engineering database and can be displayed through Chronograph, Rubin TV, and others.
		To verify these efforts, we demonstrate the capabilities during the observatory visit. 
				
		\item System Maintenance
		%new_hd
		Maintenance started as soon as the Observatory started to use components that needed maintenance, such as generators.
		We have implemented a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) and connected it to our work management system (Jira) 
		
		\item System Availability
		%new_hd
		The system availability depends on several technical aspects. Principally power and cooling. 
		We have a staged system with the national grid as a primary power source to ensure power. 
		As a backup, we have three power levels with decreasing capabilities: two generators and UPS batteries.
		Cooling consists of redundant Chillers and pumps that can make the best use of the cooling power stored in the system.
		At CCR1, the power and cooling installations are presented. 
		%Present ongoing efforts to improve the switch between power source distribution and syncing.
		
		\item System Time References
		%new_hd
		For the time reference, we have a local time server connected to the internet providing high precision time reference at any given moment.  		
		
	\end{itemize}

\item Detailed Specifications:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Science and Bulk Data
		
		\item Optical System 
		%new_hd
		The optical system consists of the three mirror surfaces, the camera lenses, and the detectors. Each element has been tested indiv
		idually. At CCR1, we present an overview of the artifacts collected during the fabrication and coating processes.
		
		\item System Throughput
		
		This is addressed in the SRD section.
		
		\item Camera System
		The LSSTCam is still in verification during the time of the CCR1
		We will present the actual state of the testing, integration, and commissioning activities and a plan to finalize the commissioning.
		
		\item Photometric Calibration
		The calibration system is still being verified during the time of the CCR1.
		We will present the actual state of the testing, integration, and commissioning activities and a plan to finalize the commissioning.
		
		\item System Timing and Dynamics
		We present the status of the TMA testing and integration with the attached subsystems.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\item Education and Public Outreach
	EPO has already entered operations. During CCR1, we briefly present their status.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Criteria for Completeness}
Compliance with this objective will follow the process defined in the Verification and Validation Process document (\citeds{LSE-160}) and associated documentation.  
All technical specifications in the OSS (\citeds{LSE-30}) and LSR (\citeds{LSE-29}) are expected to be met at the end of construction.

\subsection{Pre--Operations Interaction}
None. Unless there are non-compliance issues with the ORR requirements and specifications.

\subsection{Artifacts for Completion}

\begin{itemize}
 
	\item Verification matrix containing entries for all OSS requirements and specifications.  The verification method: inspection, demonstration, analysis or test shall be identified for every OSS requirement.  Final compliance status will be included.
	\item Analysis reports where the verification method has been identified as "test" or "analysis".
	\item Non-compliance reports.

\end{itemize}
