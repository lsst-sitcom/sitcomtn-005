\section{Operational Procedures} \label{sec:docs}

\subsection{Operations Readiness Requirement}

The project team shall deliver a complete set of documented operational procedures and supporting technical documents needed to operate the LSST as a scientific facility for the purpose of conducting a 10-year survey.

\subsection{Objectives:}

The objective with this Operational Requirement is to ensure that the procedures necessary for operations and maintenance of the Rubin Observatory are documented and provided in a form that allows the operations team conduct the 10-year planned survey. The documentation is to include but is not limited to:


\subsection{Criteria for Completeness}

The documentation is to include but is not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Process procedures describing user level standard operations;
	\item Maintenance needs and procedures for all systems in use;
	\item A history of maintenance carried out during construction and commissioning;
	\item System software documentation - including their operating versions, functionality, interactions with other systems;
	\item he observatory feature based scheduler algorithms and documentation for modification and refinement
	\item A definition of initial delivered science data products  (see previous sections)

\end{itemize}

{\bf Note:} A the time of this update the Project has recently stood up a "Documentation Working Group".  This working group is responsible for defining the architecture of the delivered documentation repositories.

\subsection{Pre--Operations Interactions}

The final delivered documentation will be negotiated between the Rubin Construction Project and Rubin Operations.

\subsection{Artifacts for ORR}

See Criteria above.
