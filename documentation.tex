\section{Operational Procedures and Technical Documentation} \label{sec:docs}

\subsection{Operations Readiness Requirement}

The project team shall deliver a complete set of documented operational procedures and supporting technical documents needed to operate the LSST as a scientific facility for the purpose of conducting a 10-year survey.

\subsection{Objectives:}

The objective with this Operational Requirement is to ensure that the procedures necessary for operations and maintenance of the LSST Observatory System are documented and provided in a form that allows the operations team conduct the 10-year planned survey.  The documentation is to include but is not limited to:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Technical as-built design records - including functional descriptions; 3-D CAD files; drawing files used for fabrication; and software code and it's associated documentation and any as-built metrology;
	\item Process procedures describing user level standard operations;
	\item Maintenance needs and procedures for all systems in use;
	\item System software documentation - including their functionality, interacts with other systems and the observatory scheduler algorithm; and
	\item A configuration management plan for observatory wide software systems.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Criteria for Completeness}

\begin{itemize}

	\item A clearly defined and documented architecture and implementation for the Project's varied documentation.  This includes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As-built drawings, diagrams and metrology
		\item Operating software versions and their documentations
		\item CAD models and fabrication drawings
		\item Documented operations procedures
		\item Documented maintenance needs and procedures
		\item Definition of delivered data properties
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item A WEB based (and associated document) roadmap / directory for the Project's document repositories (see above).
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pre--Operations Interactions}

The final delivered documentation will be negotiated between the Rubin Construction Project and Rubin Operations.

\subsection{Artifacts for ORR}

See Criteria above.
