\section{As-Built Record, Modifications, non-Compliance and Recommendations} \label{sec:recs}

\subsection{Operations Readiness Requirement}
The project team shall deliver all reports documenting the as-built hardware and software including: drawings, source code, modifications, compliance exceptions, and recommendations for improvement.

\subsection{Objectives:}

The objective of this readiness requirement is to ensure that the Construction Provide a record of the current state of the Rubin Observatory system at the time of its handover to the operations program.

A point of clarification: The Data Management science pipelines will be undergoing continuous development.  Commissioning will work with a specific release of the Rubin software stack.  The timing of which release will be used in commissioning will coincide with the readiness of the science camera -- LSSTCam.  Reporting of non-compliance of science pipeline functionality will be measured against this static release of the Rubin software stack.

\subsection{Criteria for Completeness}

The criteria for completeness of this requirement will be the production and delivery of the reports list in the artifacts below.  These reports shall document the final state of the observatory and non-compliance as known at the time of the conclusion of the commissioning phase of the project.  The reporting shall include recommendations for corrective measures for requirement found to be non-compliant and any recommendations for operational improvements based on the knowledge learned from the commissioning program.

\subsection{Pre--Operations Interactions}

The documentation provided by the Rubin Construction Project will conform to the document archiving architecture developed by the Rubm Operations team.

\subsection{Artifacts for ORR}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Report(s) documenting final as--built configuration of the hardware and software (see previous section)
	\item Report(s) documenting any modifications to the observatory that deviates for planned implements - {\it e.g.} field modifications made during the course of final commissioning activities;
	\item Report(s) of any non-compliance with system requirements and specifications;
	\item A report on the unresolved "punch list" items -- these are technical items that will need attention post construction completeness to improve operational performance, but extend beyond verification of system requirements; and
	\item A report from the Construction of recommendation for improvements based on results from commissioning.
	
\end{itemize}
