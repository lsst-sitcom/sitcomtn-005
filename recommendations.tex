\section{As-Built Record, Modifications, non-Compliance and Recommendations} \label{sec:recs}

\subsection{Operations Readiness Requirement}
The project team shall deliver all reports documenting the as-built hardware and software including: drawings, source code, modifications, compliance exceptions, and recommendations for improvement.

\subsection{Objectives:}

The objective of this readiness requirement is to ensure that the Construction Provide a record of the current technical state of the Rubin Observatory system and knowledge transfer necessary for operations and further development of the Rubin Observatory are provided in a form that allows the operations team conduct the 10-year planned survey.

A point of clarification: The Data Management science pipelines will be undergoing continuous development.  Commissioning will work with a specific release of the Rubin software stack.  The timing of which release will be used in commissioning will coincide with the readiness of the science camera -- LSSTCam.  Reporting of non-compliance of science pipeline functionality will be measured against this static release of the Rubin software stack.

\subsection{Criteria for Completeness}

The criteria for completeness of this requirement will be the production and delivery of the reports list in the artifacts below.  These reports shall document the final state of the observatory and non-compliance as known at the time of the conclusion of the commissioning phase of the project.  The reporting shall include recommendations for corrective measures for requirement found to be non-compliant and any recommendations for operational improvements based on the knowledge learned from the commissioning program.

Specific items include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A configuration management plan for observatory wide software systems
	\item A clearly defined and documented architecture and implementation for the Project's varied documentation.  This includes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Design documents describing the technical implementation for all major subsystems
		\item 3D CAD models and fabrication drawings
		\item Operating software versions and their documentations
		\item Definition of delivered data properties
		\item Software source codes and their documentations
		\item As-built drawings, diagrams and metrology
		\item Clear traceability between the systems requirements and how they were verified
		\item Clear traceability and documentation for deviations/waivers to the systems requirements
		\item Verification artifacts including test results, analyses, and inspection reports
		\item FRACAS reportable failures during integration, verification, and commissioning
		\item Hazard Analysis including hazard mitigation verifications
		\item FMEA for all major subsystems
	\item A WEB based (and associated document) roadmap / directory for the Project's document repositories (see above).
\end{itemize}

{\bf NOTE:} A the time of this update the Project has recently stood up a "Documentation Working Group".  This working group is responsible for defining the architecture of the delivered documentation repositories.

\subsection{Pre--Operations Interactions}

The documentation provided by the Rubin Construction Project will conform to the document archiving architecture developed by the Rubin Operations team.  The final delivered documentation will be negotiated between the Rubin Construction Project and Rubin Operations.

\subsection{Artifacts for ORR}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Report(s) documenting final as--built configuration of the hardware and software (see previous section)
	\item Report(s) documenting any modifications to the observatory that deviates for planned implements - {\it e.g.} field modifications made during the course of final commissioning activities;
	\item Report(s) of any non-compliance with system requirements and specifications;
	\item A report on the unresolved "punch list" items -- these are technical items that will need attention post construction completeness to improve operational performance, but extend beyond verification of system requirements; and
	\item A report from the Construction of recommendation for improvements based on results from commissioning.
\end{itemize}
